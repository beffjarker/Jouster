      Jouster is a portfolio of artistic works, thought processes, and creative pursuits.
    </p>
    <p>
      This collection explores themes that fascinate: the golden ratio's elegant proportions,
      Fibonacci sequences unfolding in nature, fractal patterns repeating infinitely,
      and tesseracts challenging our perception of dimension. These mathematical and geometric
      concepts serve as both inspiration and foundation for artistic experimentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here you'll find art, music, and creative expression—a personal exploration
      with no grand mission beyond the simple act of creating and sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to this quiet corner of the web, where art exists for its own sake.
