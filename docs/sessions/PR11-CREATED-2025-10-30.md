## ⚠️ GitHub Actions Workflow Status

### Workflows Triggered
The PR triggered several workflows, but they're **failing due to a billing issue**:

| Workflow | Status | Run ID | Issue |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| Deploy PR Preview Environment | ❌ Failed | 18932656919 | Billing/spending limit |
| PR Preview and Validation | ❌ Failed | 18932656894 | Billing/spending limit |
| Dependency Review | ❌ Failed | 18932656912 | Billing/spending limit |

### Error Message
```
The job was not started because recent account payments have failed 
or your spending limit needs to be increased. 

Please check the 'Billing & plans' section in your settings
```

### What This Means
- ✅ **PR is created successfully** - Code is ready for review
- ❌ **Preview environment NOT deployed** - Due to GitHub Actions billing issue
- ⚠️ **Action Required:** Need to resolve billing issue in GitHub settings

---

## 🔧 Resolution Steps

### Option 1: Fix GitHub Actions Billing
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Billing & plans
2. Check GitHub Actions spending limit
3. Update payment method if needed
4. Increase spending limit if necessary
5. Re-run the workflows manually

### Option 2: Manual Preview Environment (Temporary)
If you need to test immediately while waiting for billing resolution:

```bash
# Build locally
npm run build

# Deploy manually to preview bucket
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://jouster-preview-pr11-feature-v002 --delete --region us-west-2

# Preview URL would be:
# http://jouster-preview-pr11-feature-v002.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com
```

### Option 3: Skip Preview, Merge When Ready
Since this is primarily documentation and workflow files:
- Review the changes in GitHub
- Test locally if needed
- Merge when ready (will trigger QA deployment to qa.jouster.org)
