# Security Notes:
# - aws/credentials is in .gitignore - it should NEVER be committed
# - Rotate credentials regularly (every 90 days)
# - Use separate IAM users for dev, staging, production
# - Enable MFA on AWS Console access
# - Use principle of least privilege for IAM permissions
# - Consider using AWS Secrets Manager for production credentials
